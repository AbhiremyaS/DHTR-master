The handwriting recognition system is implemented using Python. Modules such as Opencv and
Tensorflow are used.The Handwriting Recognition System uses a Neural Network to train the
dataset. It consists of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) layers, Recurrent Neural Network
(RNN) layers and a final Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) layer.The model is trained with the help of the IAM dataset.
